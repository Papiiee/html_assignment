		<p> I'm just a simple girl who cleared highschool in 2018.
		    With a dream of becoming a Software Engineer,I joined Cytonn for exposure to this Tech World.
		    So far,its been fun.
		    I've met 3 Lecturers so far,Mike who introduced Linux to me and my 3 other classmates,Njogu who taught about Vagrant and Virtualization & Johnson who is currently teaching HTML.  
		</p>
		<p> My former highschool was Moi Girls' School Nairobi.
			Quite a lovely school actually.It taught me a lot about dealing with girl drama haha!
			But besides all that,all I loved about the school was that i became an effective First Aider.
			Thats like after i joined St.John's Ambulance since 2016.
			I also made friends whom I'll keep for life! I'm so glad I'm DONE with highschool though!!
		</p>
		<p> I mostly enjoy listening to music,the genres I love best are Afro Beats,House,Reggae and Trap.
			I also enjoy cooking a lot.I'm really interested in learning how to cook any foreign foods i come across between now and the rest of my life!
			Fancy restaurants like Cj's,The Local Grill,Charlie's & Nyama Mama really fascinate me too.
			Watching memes and laughing all the time at them is definitely a hooby too hah!
